# Bike Sharing

### Overview of Project

  In this project, we took a look at Citi Bikes data from 2019 and used Tableau to visualize different insights we gathered from the data.
  
### Results

  Here we will go over 7 visualizations that we gathered from the data.
  
#### Visualizations

Here we have a visualization showing trip duration times. What we can gather is that a huge majority of trips made (145k+) are only under 10 minutes long. This shows us that users are mainly only using Citi Bike for short distance travels as opposed to long distance. This also shows us that there are no trips exceeding 3 hours.
